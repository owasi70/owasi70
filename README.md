<h1>About Me: </h1>
I’m a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student from AIUB with hands-on experience in full-stack development, specializing in scalable and secure web applications. Throughout my university courses, I’ve developed ERP solutions, B2C marketplaces, and booking platforms. I’m proficient in languages like C, C++, C#, JavaScript, and PHP, with a strong focus on frameworks and technologies such as ReactJS, ASP.NET, and SQL. 
Currently, I’m focused on game development, enhancing experiences with game engines like Unity, Unreal, and Godot. As a gamer and streamer, I enjoy creating content, streaming on Twitch, and posting gaming videos on YouTube.
